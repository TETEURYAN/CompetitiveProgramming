# Graph Algorithms

Part of the graph algorithms were developed in CPP in another repository.

## Algorithms
- Minimum Path in a Digraph: [Bellman-Ford](https://github.com/TETEURYAN/GraphTeory/tree/main/bellman)
- Minimum Path in a graph: [Dijkstra's](https://github.com/TETEURYAN/GraphTeory/tree/main/dijkstra)
- Minimum Path with DP in a graph: [Floyd-Warshall](https://github.com/TETEURYAN/GraphTeory/tree/main/warshall)
- Minimum Spanning Tree with greedy in a graph: [Prim](https://github.com/TETEURYAN/GraphTeory/tree/main/prim)
- Minimum Spanning Tree with Union-Find in a graph: [Kruskal](https://github.com/TETEURYAN/GraphTeory/tree/main/kruskal)
- Maximum flow in a graph: [Ford-Fulkerson](https://github.com/TETEURYAN/GraphTeory/tree/main/fulkerson)
- Topological Order in a graph: [Kahn](https://github.com/TETEURYAN/GraphTeory/tree/main/Kahn)
